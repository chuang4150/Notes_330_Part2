# Notes_330_Part2
 Our note-taking project has the ability to report notes that have selected mentions and topics. It can also sort the notes in topological order. The current version of the project has five updated features.

## Features of NoteTaking System:
  
     #1- Create and Save new notes:	
	      User is able to create a new file by selecting the apprpriate option. Before the note is created, the user is able to save it in a particular folder. 
            
     #2- Edit and view existing notes, including deleting of notes:
          By selecting the appropraite option for the prompt, the user is able to add to an existing note. The user is also able to view the particular note or a list of existing notes in a folder.         
            
     #3- Navigating the system by using Refernces:
          User is able to use references in notes to navigate between notes, that is, accessing refernced notes directly. The system displays the list of all the referenced notes and gives the user the option to quickly view one of them. For example, if note A references B and C, these notes can be accessed directly from note A with no need to navigate through all other notes.             
          
     #4- Interactive UserInterface:
          The system has an interactive User-Interface to access the feaatures on the notetaking system. The user has more control over what is reported to them.
	  
     #5- Organizing Files/notes:
         The system is able to organize text files into smaller sub-folders based on the user's choosing. User can save a note in a desired folder or can move a file to another folder as well. A default folder is also provided.

## User instructions:
Run UserInterface.py and follow the prompts
### Note format:
The body of each note may contain three special characteristics:

	#1- mentions: beginning with the @ symbol, these are useful for mentioning other users
	#2- topics: beginning with the # symbol, these allow topics to be discovered quickly and efficiently
	#3- references: use the ^ symbol before the name of an existing note to link it to your new note
